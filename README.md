Website:

Game explanation: Simon game will tell which button to press for the user. If user clear the current level, computer will tell user the second button to pressed, user needs to press the first button and second button.(ex, first button is red, second button is yellow, user needs to press red first, then yellow on the second level). Please take a try, my best level is 9, which pretty bad lol.
