Game explanation: Simon game will tell user which button to press. If user clear the current level, computer will tell user the second button to press. User needs to press the first button and second button.(ex, first button is red, second button is yellow, user needs to press red first, then yellow on the second level). Please try it out and test your best memory, my best level is 9, which pretty bad lol.
